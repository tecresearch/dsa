# Mastery in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), categorized into primitive and non-primitive data structures, various algorithms, and the collection framework. This guide is designed to help learners and practitioners deepen their understanding and application of DSA concepts.

## Table of Contents

### 1. Primitive Data Structures
- **Integers**: Whole numbers, both positive and negative.
- **Floats**: Numbers with decimal points.
- **Booleans**: Data type with two possible values: true or false.
- **Characters**: Single letters or symbols, typically represented as a byte.

### 2. Non-Primitive Data Structures

#### 2.1 Linear Data Structures
- **Arrays**: A collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
- **Linked Lists**: A sequence of elements where each element points to the next.
- **Stacks**: A collection of elements that follows Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Queues**: A collection of elements that follows First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.

#### 2.2 Non-Linear Data Structures
- **Trees**
  - **Binary Trees**: A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children.
  - **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child is less than the parent and the right child is greater.
  - **Heaps**: A special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.
  - **Tries**: A type of search tree used to store a dynamic set of strings.
  
- **Graphs**
  - **Directed Graphs**: A graph where edges have a direction.
  - **Undirected Graphs**: A graph where edges do not have a direction.
  - **Weighted Graphs**: A graph in which each edge has a weight or cost associated with it.
  
- **Hash-based Structures**
  - **Hash Tables / Hash Maps**: A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type.

## Getting Started

To begin your journey in mastering DSA:

1. **Choose a Programming Language**: Start with a language that you are comfortable with, such as Python, Java, or C++.
2. **Understand Basic Structures**: Implement and practice with primitive and linear data structures.
3. **Learn Algorithms**: Study sorting and searching algorithms first, then progress to more complex algorithms.
4. **Practice Problems**: Use online platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal to solve DSA problems.
5. **Explore Collections Framework**: Familiarize yourself with various interfaces and their implementations.
